# ANTSUN

Implements the Automatic Neuron Tracking System for Unconstrained Nematodes. This notebook takes as input raw video data from NIR and confocal microscopes and outputs neural traces and behavioral parameters for that worm.

## Neural network weights

Most neural network weights should be available in [our Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/records/8185377). We've since updated the 3D U-Net segmentation network to include NeuroPAL training data; the updated weights are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zn530f0lnw9p8wqssqfwq/h?rlkey=01izs13oa9ef4hdw9ielhaqcx&dl=0).
